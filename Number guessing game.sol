/*
 Number Guessing Game (no imports, no constructor, no input fields)
 - Owner must call initialize() once after deployment to claim ownership.
 - Owner sets a commitment hash with setCommit(bytes32).
   The commitment is keccak256(abi.encodePacked(uint8 secretNumber, bytes32 salt)).
 - Players call guess(uint8 number) with ETH to place a bet on that number.
 - Owner reveals with reveal(uint8 secretNumber, bytes32 salt).
   On reveal, contract verifies the commitment, finds winners, and distributes
   the contract balance pro rata to winners who bet on the correct number.
 - If a transfer to a winner fails, their owed amount is saved in pendingWithdrawals.
 - Security notes:
   * Commitâ€“reveal prevents owner changing secret after players bet.
   * Avoid excessively many distinct guessers for a single number (gas limits).
   * No constructor used; initialize() sets owner and must be called once.
